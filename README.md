Astrophysical Fuild Stimulation in HLL scheme
=============================================
These are the source codes of my final year
project in CUHK Physics surpvised by Dr Leung
Po Kin. 

The aim of this project is to familiar
with the numerical method in astrophysical 
simulation. 

Please check the report.pdf for all the details
in this project. 

Please feel free to modify the codes if you
are interested in fluid stimulation. 

How to run
-----------------------------------------------
```bash
	javac main.java NumericalMethod/*.java
	java Main
```
Please change the parameters in constructor and
the output scheme in method iterate() in HLL.java.
The output scheme was not standardized for sake of
flexible output.
